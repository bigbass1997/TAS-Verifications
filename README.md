Verification progress is tracked in a spreadsheet. Excel (.xlsx) and OpenDocument (.ods) formats are provided for easy access. **This repo only pertains to my own verification efforts.** If instead, you are looking for a list of all verifications, I highly recommend going to https://runs.tas.bot/

Each TAS verification has a corresponding zip archive containing all relevent files such as the inputs and any configuration info for replay devices. Archives are organized by console and by game. They are named based on tasvideos.com publication ID, submission ID, or some other source identifier.

Scripts used in dumping these inputs from emulators are found in the `scripts/` directory. Open the script in a text editor for more information about the script's usage and purpose.
